# Azamat-M

Throughout my 2 years as a Back End developer, I managed to get a different experience:

- I've worked in outsourcing, outstaff and product-oriented companies.
- I was in a leadership position at my last job and had 3 developers on my team
- I have experience in both starting projects from scratch and working with older code.

I believe I can contribute greatly to your company, not just in coding, but also in managing teams, and improving internal processes.
